FlashR-learn contains a large set of machine learning algorithms implemented
on top of FlashR. Most of the implementations are ported from other R packages
such as MASS and e1071. The project aims to provide a high-quality, highly
efficient machine learning library in R. It also demonstrates how machine
learning algorithms can be implemented in FlashR.
**The work is in progress.**
